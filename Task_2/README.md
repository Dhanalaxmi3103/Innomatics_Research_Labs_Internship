## Python Problem Solving – Internship Task 2

This repository contains solutions to a set of Python programming and algorithmic problems completed as part of an internship technical task.
The objective of this task is to demonstrate problem-solving skills, Python fundamentals, and logical thinking using clean and readable code.

All solutions are implemented and tested in a Jupyter Notebook: Task2.ipynb.

## Objective

Strengthen core Python programming concepts

Practice algorithmic thinking using interview-style problems

Write clean, readable, and efficient code

## Technologies & Tools

--Python 3
--Jupyter Notebook
--Core Python concepts:
--Loops & conditionals
--Strings & lists
--Dictionaries
--Mathematical operations
--Bitwise operations

## Problems Implemented
1️. Defanging an IP Address

Converts a valid IPv4 address by replacing "." with "[.]".
Demonstrates string manipulation.

2️. Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits

Counts how many integers in a list contain an even number of digits.
Demonstrates number handling and loops.

3️. Number of Good Pairs

Counts pairs (i, j) where:
nums[i] == nums[j]
i < j
Demonstrates nested logic and frequency counting.

4️. Smaller Numbers Than Current

For each element, finds how many numbers are smaller than it.
Demonstrates array traversal and comparison logic.

5️. Subtract Product and Sum of Digits

Calculates:
(Product of digits) − (Sum of digits)
Demonstrates digit extraction and arithmetic operations.

6️. XOR Operation in an Array

Generates an array using:
nums[i] = start + 2*i
Returns the bitwise XOR of all elements.
Demonstrates bitwise operations and iteration.
