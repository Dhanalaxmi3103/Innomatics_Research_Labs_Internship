### Data Scienc with Gen AI Internship - Task 1
##  Python Basics

# Overview
This repository contains the first task of the internship, which focuses on learning and practicing basic Python concepts. The task is completed in a Jupyter Notebook (Internship_Python_Basics.ipynb) to get comfortable with writing and executing Python code interactively.

# Topics Covered
--Input and output --Conditional statements --Loops (for) --Functions --Simple logic-based programs

# Objective
The main objective of this task is to:

Build a strong foundation in Python programming

Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills

Understand how to use Jupyter Notebook effectively

# Tools Used
--Python

--Jupyter Notebook

# Conclusion
This first internship task helped in revising and strengthening Python basics. It acts as the stepping stone for further learning and development throughout the internship.

###  Python Advanced
# Overview

This task contains Python solutions to three popular programming problems. The objective of this task is to improve problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and coding efficiency using Python functions.

# Problems Covered in This Task

--> Running Sum of 1D Array

  Calculates cumulative sum of elements in a list.

--> Shuffle the Array

  Rearranges elements of an array from the format [x1, x2, …, xn, y1, y2, …, yn] to [x1, y1, x2, y2, …].
  
--> Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

  Determines which children could have the most candies if extra candies are added.

# Code Summary

The task includes three functions:

--> runningSum(arr)
Generates a list where each element is the running total of the numbers from the start of the array.

--> shuffleArray(array, n)
Combines two halves of the array by alternating elements.

--> kidsWithGreatestCandies(candies, extraCandies)
Returns a list of True/False values based on whether each child can have the greatest candies after adding extra candies.

# Objective of the Task

Strengthen logic building using Python

Practice writing clean, reusable functions

Become familiar with solving coding interview-style problems

# Conclusion

The task successfully demonstrates the use of loops, lists, and logical conditions in solving real problem-based challenges. It is a good step in improving coding confidence and logical reasoning during the internship.
